# Haritham
This project leverages gamification to inspire communities in reducing plastic waste. Users earn points, unlock badges, and compete in panchayat-based leaderboards. Monthly challenges and rewards, like redeemable reusable bags, encourage ongoing participation, fostering community pride and environmental responsibility.
